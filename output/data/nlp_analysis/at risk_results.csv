84,at risk,table adaptive strategies for flood protection infrastructure under current and future compound hazards over two-thirds of the american population lives in counties protected against flooding by the levee system. historically underserved and socially vulnerable communities (husvcs) are particularly at risk due to their high exposure and barriers to mitigation. this award supports a transdisciplinary research project to explore climate-informed strategies for equitable adaptation of levees under compound hazards to address these challenges. the research project aims to ensure the resilience of the nat,CLIMA/Collaborative Research: Equitable Adaptive Strategies for Flood Protection Infrastructure under Current and Future Compound Hazards,NSF,POLITICAL,"The phrase ""historically underserved and socially vulnerable communities (husvcs) are particularly at risk"" indicates a focus on social and political factors that contribute to vulnerability. The concern for equity and the mention of ""historically underserved"" populations further reinforce this classification.
