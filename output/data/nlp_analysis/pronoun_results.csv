The term ""pronoun"" is not present in the text. Therefore, the text does not use the word ""pronoun"". However, the grant title discusses ""Racial Discrimination"" which could point to the POLITICAL category, but since the main body focuses on the scientific investigation of the psychological effects, SCIENTIFIC is the most appropriate classification for the whole context.

5,pronoun,"ed outcomes of this project also include decreased attrition, increased research participation, and higher graduation rates of students who participate as peer-leaders, compared to other psychology majors. finally, consistent with peer learning implementation in other stem-focused courses, the most pronounced improvements are expected to be among black and hispanic students. the project aims to develop a ""pebble in a box"" solution that can be easily adapted by other disciplines and other institutions. the hsi program aims to enhance undergraduate stem education and build capacity at hsis. projects su",HSI Implementation and Evaluation Project: Using Peer-Enhanced Blockchain-Based Learning Environments to Promote Student Engagement and Retention,NSF,POLITICAL,"The text discusses ""black and hispanic students"" and aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education at HSIs (Hispanic-Serving Institutions). This clearly relates to demographics and institutional support based on ethnicity, placing the context in a political or social domain related to representation and equity. While education is scientific, the mention of specific demographics moves the focus into the political realm.

9,pronoun,"national data show that engineering students experiencing mental health distress are significantly less likely than their peers to seek professional mental health help. while treatment gaps exist for cisgender men, persons of color, and first-generation students, these group disparities are further pronounced among engineering students. in this study, we aim to address these concerns about mental health treatment underutilization in engineering through a theoretically grounded, multi-institution study of the beliefs influencing professional help seeking in diverse engineering student populations. thi",Research: Identifying intervention targets to increase mental health help seeking in undergraduate engineers,NSF,POLITICAL,"The text discusses disparities among ""cisgender men, persons of color, and first-generation students,"" which are categories of identity and social groups, indicating a political or social context related to equity and inclusion.
