46,intersectionality,"deepening candidate’s research skills. in research aim 1, the candidate will assess experiences of intersectional discrimination (e.g., hiv stigma, racism, classism) in relation to hiv prevention and care through in-depth qualitative interviews with transgender women (training aim 1: application of intersectionality to qualitative methods). in research aim 2, the candidate will conduct a survey to characterize and longitudinally test the pathways that link intersectional discrimination with hiv prevention and care linkage outcomes over a 6-month period (training aim 2: epidemiological methods and longitudinal ",Intersectional discrimination and linkage to HIV prevention and care in transgender women in Ecuador,NIH,SCIENTIFIC,"The term 'intersectionality' is used within the research aims to describe and analyze the combined effects of multiple forms of discrimination (HIV stigma, racism, classism) on health outcomes related to HIV prevention and care. This is a technical application of the concept within a scientific study.

The term ""intersectionality"" is likely used to describe how multiple social identities (e.g., Latino, sexual minority, men) intersect to create unique experiences of stigma and barriers to healthcare. This aligns with a scientific approach to understanding complex social determinants of health.
