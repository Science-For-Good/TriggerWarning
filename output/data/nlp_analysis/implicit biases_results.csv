2,implicit biases,"versity of detroit mercy addresses the need for fostering the development of underrepresented research scholars for careers in teaching and research in the biomedical sciences. by increasing the diversity of underrepresented persons in positions of leadership at research intensive institutions, the implicit biases that limit access to these positions can be overcome. in addition, underrepresented persons with advanced degrees in research will serve as role models for more junior trainees in the science pipeline who need peer mentors to help visualize themselves at academic institutions with a career in biome",U-RISE at University of Detroit Mercy,NIH,POLITICAL,"The text discusses increasing diversity and overcoming barriers for underrepresented persons in positions of leadership, which is a social and political issue. The implicit biases are presented as limiting access to these positions, framing it within a context of social justice and equity.
