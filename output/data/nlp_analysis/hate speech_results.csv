6,hate speech,"ia sites this research will analyze expectations and interactions of social media platform users with flagging tools in each phase of the flagging lifecycle. platforms offer flagging, a technical feature that empowers users to report inappropriate posts or bad actors, to reduce online harm, such as hate speech, nonconsensual sharing of sexual photos, etc. however, prior research shows that reporting harms can be experienced as secondary victimization, especially when victims perceive a lack of procedural justice. flags play a critical role in maintaining the feasibility of content moderation systems, an ",HCC: Small: Incorporating Procedural Fairness in Flagging Mechanisms on Social Media Sites,NSF,POLITICAL,"The term 'hate speech' is being used within the context of online harm, content moderation, and flagging inappropriate posts on social media platforms. This falls under the umbrella of social and political concerns related to online discourse and its impact on individuals and groups.
