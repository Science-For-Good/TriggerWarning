# TriggerWarning: Analysis of Terminated Federal Research Grants

A comprehensive analysis of recently terminated NIH and NSF grants containing specific "trigger terms" to determine how frequently these terms appear in specialized technical scientific contexts versus interdisciplinary social scientific contexts.

## Key Findings

- 40.9% of trigger term occurrences represent specialized technical scientific usage rather than interdisciplinary social scientific usage
- Certain terms show particularly high rates of specialized technical scientific usage: "racial inequality" (near 100%), "pregnant persons" (near 100%), "person-centered care" (near 100%)
- Scientific fields like Biology and Physics show distinct patterns of terminology usage in specialized technical contexts
- A dramatic spike in grant terminations occurred in March 2025 (1,827 grants), followed by a reduced but substantial number in April 2025 (562 grants)
- Research-intensive universities (R1) and schools of medicine bore the brunt of terminations
- Significant regional variations exist, with the Northeast experiencing the highest number of terminations (720)
- Different patterns emerged across NIH institutes (NIMH, NIMHD most affected) and NSF directorates (STEM Education, SBE most affected)
